        I am the most active there so just DM me. Below are some products I worked hard on but even more 
        importantly, I care alot about. 
        I have not written my tech stack and other things here because
        I do a lot of things. My projects will give you an idea of what
        I am good at but give me anything that you want to build, I will build it.
